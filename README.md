- Capture their likeness by adding your own take on the character's personality and what you believe makes them special.
- Distill the essence of their persona down to a paragraph or two with descriptive language.
- Focus on both strong and weak traits, mannerisms, quirks, and overall presence.
- Prevent the urge to make a character perfect, highlight some of their shortcomings.
- When crafting the scenario, set the stage by giving the characters place and purpose.
